# Portfolio and ecommerce site project

For my project I would like to build a site for my wife's book binding and conservation studio. As such elements of both a Artist's or Developer's portfolio and a Shop will be required to complete this site. 

##### As I have not done a fully integrated Ecommerce site before that will be the main challenge for me to set up.

I further hope to add the following functionalities if time permits:  
1. Display Projects using Modals or Lightboxes to limit clutter on the page and limit redirects
2. Have a submittion form page that creates an order that can be accessed from an "admin page" (Short term this may just be sent via email)
3. Instagram feed connections
    - See if I can add images to projects based on tags from instagram
4. Have a search function that will allow Projects on the page to be found based on similar parameters. ie, Fine Binding
5. Paralax Effect on the homepage 


### MVP requirements
    - p0
        * A clean homepage with easily accessible links to the Projects pages and Shop Site
        * A shop page with the ability to see available items and make purchases
        * A projects page displaying projects both done and being worked on
        * An About page that will have more information as well as more contact information.
        * Links to Email, Instagram, possibly linkedin and more based on what is needed.

    - p1
        * Setting up a Quote Form for a customer to ask for a Custom book or request a rebind of a former edition. 

    - p2
        * On Scroll down the Header Logo collapses but the navigation bars remain
        * Create a tagging feature for the projects so they can be easily searched for.
        * Projects to be displayed in Modals (on click) from the projects page so the projects page can be minimal and linking can be minimized.
        * Create an admin page for the owner to go in and manage custom requests
        * The ability to buy editions from the projects page if editions are still available.
    
    - p3 and beyond
        * Parallax effect on the homepage.
        * Instagram incorporation so that pictures can be automatically added to projects.
